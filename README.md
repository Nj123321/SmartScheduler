# This repo is a Spring Boot Demo of a course optimizing feature
- currently working on implementing feature into https://berkeleytime.com/ (They first need to do a database migration to a graph database)
- developed backtracking algorithim to find optimial course schedule based on user requirements, difficulty, prerequisite proximity
- for more information: https://www.nathanjin.com/html/amazonLITE.html
- Currently functionality is completely solid, it just works enough to function for the demo - currently updating
- Schedule managing and optimizing algorithim in /Scheduler
- Course and prerequisite management in /CourseCatalog
